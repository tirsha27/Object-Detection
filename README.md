Project Title: Object Detection System Using Python and OpenCV
Objective:
    The goal of this project is to build an object detection system that can identify and classify objects in images or real-time video streams using a pre-trained deep learning model such as YOLO, SSD, or Faster R-CNN.

Technologies Used:
    Programming Language: Python
    Libraries & Frameworks: OpenCV, TensorFlow/Keras, PyTorch, NumPy, Matplotlib
    Pre-trained Models: YOLOv4/Yolov5, SSD, Faster R-CNN
    Hardware: Works on CPU but GPU recommended for faster inference
Features:
    ✅ Detect multiple objects in an image or video
    ✅ Draw bounding boxes with labels and confidence scores
    ✅ Real-time object detection using a webcam
    ✅ Save and analyze detection results
    ✅ Custom dataset training (optional)

Implementation Steps:
    Install Dependencies: Install OpenCV, TensorFlow/PyTorch, and required deep learning libraries.
    Load Pre-trained Model: Use a model like YOLO or SSD to detect objects.
    Preprocess Input: Convert images to the required format (resize, normalize).
    Perform Object Detection: Use the model to detect objects and get bounding box coordinates.
    Display Results: Draw boxes and labels on the detected objects.
    Optimize Performance: Use GPU acceleration and fine-tune parameters.
    Custom Dataset Training (Optional): Train on a specific dataset for better accuracy.
Expected Outcome:
    A fully functional object detection system capable of identifying and labeling multiple objects in real-time or from static images, with high accuracy.
